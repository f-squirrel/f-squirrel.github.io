Hello and thank you for your interest in my blog! My name is Dmitry and I am a
professional software engineer with over 12 years of experience in the
industry.  I was born and grew up in Odessa, Ukraine, where I completed both my
Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science. I have been living and working in
Israel for the last 7 years and am currently working for VMware as a Senior
Blockchain Engineer.  I have working experience in both global corporations,
such as HP, and small-to-mid scale startups, and have been blogging
with increased frequency as I pinpointed my technological interests
more and more.<br>
My summarized interests and the general categories for my blog posts can be found below:
* Multithreading, multiprocessing
* Network programming
* Low-level development
* Programming languages: C++, Rust, Python
* Design of performance-sensitive systems
* Distributed systems
* Linux toolbox and VIM fine-tuning

Please feel free to get in touch if you have a topic or question that is of interest or if you have any suggestions for future posts!
