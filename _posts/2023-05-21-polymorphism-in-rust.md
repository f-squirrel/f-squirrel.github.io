When I first heard about Rust in 2013, it was like a breath of fresh air amidst the complexities of C++. At the time, C++11 had been introduced, promising to address some of the major issues with C++. However, I soon realized that it wouldn't fully resolve the inherent challenges of the language. That's when Rust appeared on the horizon, offering a compelling opportunity to tackle these problems head-on.

After encountering a few breaking changes in Rust, I decided to step back and wait for the language to stabilize. It wasn't until 2015, when Rust was officially released, that I resumed following its progress. Over the years, I kept an eye on its development, eagerly awaiting the moment when I could finally dive into using it myself. In 2022, that opportunity finally arrived, and I began my journey of exploring Rust and its approach to polymorphism. In this post, I aim to share my discoveries and insights about polymorphism in Rust, drawing comparisons to my previous experiences with C++.
