It has been almost a year since my last post. The main reason for this absence is a project that consumed much of my time and energy: writing a book.

The journey began when [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com) reached out to me after my presentation at [Core C++ 2022](https://corecpp.org/) in Tel Aviv, where I gave a talk "Considerations when Working with Shared Pointers" ([watch it on YouTube](https://www.https://corecpp.org/youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)). They proposed that I write a book about refactoring in C++. After some serious consideration, I decided to take on the challenge.

## Writing Through Challenging Times

What followed was almost two years of writing. This period was marked not only by the technical and creative demands of the book itself but also by significant events unfolding around us—the war in Ukraine and the tragic events of October 7th among them. These circumstances added weight to the process, but also underscored the value of creating something constructive and enduring.

## The Joy of Structuring Thoughts

Despite the challenges, I found the writing process deeply rewarding. Writing a book is more than putting words on paper—it’s about structuring your thoughts, distilling best practices, and providing readers with tangible insights.

In this book, I aimed to:

* Show both good and bad code examples.
* Highlight patterns I believe lead to clean, maintainable C++ code.
* Draw lessons from popular open-source libraries.
* Introduce tools that, while not strictly part of the C++ language, are invaluable in everyday development.

## Support Along the Way

I had tremendous support from [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com), and in particular from my editor [Kinnari Chohan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinnari-chohan/). Their guidance helped shape the raw drafts into something cohesive and polished. But above all, the greatest support came from my partner, Rina, without whom this book would not exist.

## The Result

On July 19, 2024, the book was finally published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/refactoring-with-c-9781837633777) and is now available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1837633770).

If you are interested in modern C++ and want to explore refactoring techniques, practical examples, and tooling, I invite you to take a look.

## What’s Next

With the book now published, I hope to write more posts here again—mainly about modern C++ and also about Rust, which I’ve become quite passionate about recently.
