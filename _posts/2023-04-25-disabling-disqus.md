This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), one of the most popular static site generators.
Jekyll solved most of my issues with the blog: I edit markdown files in a code editor, commit them to GitHub and voila I see updates as web pages. No more WordPress plugins, weird CRM, half-baked WYSIWYG web editor and many more.
However, this solution has one disadvantage: due to its static nature, there is no possibility to have built-in comments.

So I decided to add an external comment provider Disqus, fortunately, my Jekyll theme supported it out of the box.
You add their Javascript code to the website and the code loads the comments into a page.
The official website says that the free plan may add some advertisements. Well, this is fair, I thought.
What I did not expect was to see four pages of ads at the bottom of each page after two years of usage.
I assume that my blog has reached the minimum number of visitors, and Disqus decided that the time has come.
As I said, was prepared to see some ads, but four pages are too much, to say the least.

As a result, I am disabling Disqus comments except for the posts that already have comments. Most of the old posts have links to social networks, and all the new ones (including this one) will have links to Twitter, LinkedIn, and sometimes Reddit (I am still afraid of people there). I would be happy to see your comments there!
